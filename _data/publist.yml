- title: General anesthetics activate a potent central pain-suppression circuit in the amygdala

  description: General anesthesia (GA) can produce analgesia (loss of pain) independent of inducing loss of consciousness, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We hypothesized that GA suppresses pain in part by activating supraspinal analgesic circuits and discovered a distinct population of GABAergic neurons activated by GA in the mouse central amygdala (CeAGA neurons). Using in vivo calcium imaging and optogenetic activation, our study points to CeAGA as a potential powerful therapeutic target for alleviating chronic pain.

- title: A common neuroendocrine substrate for both general anesthesia and sleep
  image: Jiang-Xie_2019.jpg
  description: Previous studies have revealed that many general anesthesia (GA) drugs inhibit neural activity through targeting GABA receptors. Here, using Fos staining, ex vivo brain slice recording, and in vivo multi-channel electrophysiology, we discovered a core ensemble of hypothalamic neurons in and near the supraoptic nucleus, consisting primarily of neuroendocrine cells, which are persistently and commonly activated by multiple classes of GA drugs.
