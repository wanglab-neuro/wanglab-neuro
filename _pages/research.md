Mice use their whiskers to sense and explore the physical environment. Sensory information is first detected by trigeminal sensory neurons that innervate these whiskers and then processed by circuits in the brainstem, thalamus, and cortex that process information (such as the distance from or texture of an object). Whisker movement is driven by facial motor neurons, which also receive complex inputs from the brain. The Wang lab is mapping the detailed neural connectivity in this sensorimotor system using combinations of genetic and viral tools, as well as in vivo recording and functional manipulations of defined populations of neurons in this system. Through these approaches, we are exploring the role that specific neural populations play in touch perception and touch-guided behaviors.  

## Pain Perception and Pain Suppression

Pain perception involves two main aspects: the type of pain being felt, and the suffering and negative emotions evoked by this pain. Painful stimuli activate numerous brain regions, sometimes called the pain matrix. However, the identities of neurons and their exact roles in processing pain in each of these regions remain opaque. We are mapping the detailed connectivity of neurons linked to pain perception, recording in vivo activity using electrophysiology and imaging approaches, as well as manipulating pain-activated neurons (using activity-dependent tools) in multiple regions of the pain matrix to understand both sensory and affective pain perception, and how changes in this system contribute to the suffering associated with chronic pain.  

It is well known that in humans, belief/placebo, focused attention (such as in emergency situations or in battlefield), as well as other conditions can actually block pain perception. The Wang lab is interested in dissecting the central circuits that mediate such pain-suppression. Specifically, they are studying neural mechanisms underlying anesthetics-, placebo-, and stress-induced analgesia.  

## Circuits of Addiction

A new direction for the Wang lab is the study of circuits that play a role in drug addiction. Our team has identified neurons that are either activated or suppressed by morphine. They are currently testing the hypothesis that specific groups of morphine-inhibited neurons, when re-activated, can cause animals to crave less morphine and undertake non-drug-seeking activities. Once critical brain circuits and clusters of neurons involved in morphine-addiction are identified, the Wang lab will examine their connectivity, plasticity, and changes in function when influenced by morphine. Gaining a deeper understanding of how drugs of abuse affect these circuits will help pave the way for future treatments
